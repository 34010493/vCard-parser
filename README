Nuovo/Nouveau vCard-parser is a simple vCard file parser with the focus on ease of use.

The parser was written mostly because I couldn't find one that I was satisfied with - all those that I tried either failed with real world data or were too unwieldy or inconvenient, hence this parser.

The parser can read both single and multiple vCards from a single file and with the help of PHP's magic methods and interfaces it can be written concisely. For example:

$vCard = new vCard('Example3.0.vcf');

// Get the number of vCards in the file
echo count($vCard);

// In the single-vCard mode every element is accessible directly.
if (count($vCard) == 1)
{
	print_r($vCard -> n);
	print_r($vCard -> tel);
}
// In the multiple-vCard mode the object can be used as an array to retrieve separate vCard objects
// for each vCard in the file.
else
{
	foreach ($vCard as $vCardPart)
	{
		print_r($vCardPart -> n);
		print_r($vCardPart -> tel);
	}
}

Every vCard element is accessible as an object member by the vCard element name. Every element is an array with the data parsed out of the file.

TODOs planned:
- Add support for non-standard ("X-...") elements;
- AGENT element should return another vCard object
- Easier data access without the necessity to traverse multiple arrays.
